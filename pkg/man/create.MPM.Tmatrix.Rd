\title{
Function to build discrete T matrix
}
\description{
A method that uses bins to construct a discrete survival transition matrix of class IPM using the
data structures used by IPMpack
}
\usage{
create.MPM.Tmatrix(dataf,bins,n.env=1)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{dataf}{
	a dataframe with columns `size',
    `sizenext' (`size' is size at t, `sizenext' is size at t+1); facultatively, dataf may include `covariate'
    and `covariatel' for discrete covariates, indicating values at t,
    and at t+1, respectively; these must take values of sequential integers, starting at
    `1'. }
\item{bins}{
  limits of the desired size classes
}
\item{n.env}{
  currently not used
}
}
\details{
  The number of individuals moving from one bin to the next in one
  time-step is identified and probabilities entered into a matrix. To
  get a classic Matrix Population model this can be added to values
  defined by create.MPM.Fmatrix. Note that the assumption that all
  individuals for whom is.na(sizenext) died.
