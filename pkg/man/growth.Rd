Growth 
}
\description{
Generic function to predict the pdf of size at t+1 given size at t and a growth object
}
\usage{
growth(size, sizenext, cov, growthObj)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{size}{
    vector of current sizes
}
  \item{sizenext}{
    vector of sizes in the next time-step
}
  \item{cov}{
    covariate level in this time-step (numeric of length 1)
}
  \item{growthObj}{
    a growth object
}
}
\details{
  Models defining size at t+1, or growth increment are defined; with various
  underlying statistical models
}
\value{
  a vector of length sizenext giving the pdf of each value of sizenext
}
