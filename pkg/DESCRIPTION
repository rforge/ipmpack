Description: IPMpack takes demographic vital rates and (optionally) environmental data to build integral projection models.  A number of functional forms for growth and survival can be incorporated, as well as a range of reproductive strategies.  The package also includes a suite of diagnostic routines, provides classic matrix model output (e.g., lambda, elasticities, sensitivities), and produces post-hoc metrics (e.g., passage time and life expectancy).
